# UK Explr

## Overview

UK Explr (alt. `uk-explr`) is a scalable ETL pipeline for UK census data that transforms bulk "raw" data (CSV and JSON files) into a unified statistical lookup table with multi-resolution querying capabilities.

### Key Features

#### Flexible Geospatial Querying

Look up statistics by:

âœ… Output Area (OA)
âœ… Lower/Middle Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA/MSOA)
âœ… Local Authority Districts (LAD)
âœ… Postal Codes

#### Integrated Services

ðŸš€ Production-ready REST API for web applications

âš¡ MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for system integration â€” [TO DO](#to-do)

#### Optimised Data Processing

* Efficient handling of large datasets (e.g. UK census data)

* Normalised output structure for consistent analysis

### Use Cases

* Real estate investment

* Policy analysis & demographic research

* Location-based service development

* Academic studies requiring unified datasets

Built with reliability and scalability in mind, this pipeline serves as a robust foundation for applications requiring granular UK geospatial statistics.
